      <p class="text-muted text-left">The Taj Mahal built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife. Me and my family went there for my 8th birthday. I had a photo shoot and they took photos of me by the Taj Mahal. We also got to go inside and I was amazed! There was Shah Jahan’s tomb, though I’m pretty sure the real one is buried beneath the Taj Mahal (I researched!), and the walls had pretty designs on them. The gardens are unique and beautiful. Basically, we explored all of the Taj Mahal. It was really fun and beautiful.</p>

      <p>Avengers endgame is written and directed by Russo Brothers and stars so many people. This is a culmination of a ton of different storylines all coalescing into a gigantic finale, so after the devastating events of infinity war where Thanos wiped out half of all life in the universe, the remaining avengers are scrambling to hopefully find a way to set things right in the universe once again.</p>

    <p>As an avid fan of the original animation and the stage production, I was impressed with Jon Favreau's take on the Lion King. The animation and effects were visually stunning, and more realistic than I thought could ever be possible for a film that was entirely created using computers. However, the realism detracts feeling and emotion from some scenes, making them anti-climactic; especially the scene of Mufasa's death.</p>

          <p>I love this film, being only 7 years old when the first plot came out it seemed reasonable to make a second one. It was worth waiting 6 yrs for this movie to come out and it was fantastic with an impressive sequal. the sequel was very different from the trailer of the film and a surprise ending at the end of the plot (which I will not spoil for those reading). I always found Elsas powers very magical and astounding and they became a big part of the sequal and you could really make a connection to those scenes as you probably remembered yourself trying to do those powers at home, it was merely breathtaking that, as a teenager, now to still have that same moving connection with the same film in a fresh and original way. </p>
